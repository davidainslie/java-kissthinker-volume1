# Preface

A big chunk of the "Introduction" was originally in this Preface.
That text is quite important, and then I realised, if it were in the Preface, many would miss that text, because let's be honest, most of us skip the Preface.

Developers like to take shortcuts (and so skip the Preface) but on the other hand (I have 4 fingers and a thumb) Developers also like to over engineer and write complicated code.

By the end of this book, I hope your code becomes more:

readable -> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maintainable -> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extensible -> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;better for you -> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;better for fellow Developers.
