# Part 1 KISS

There are many amazing techies out there. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them.

I've worked with many Developers who are cleverer than me, who know language APIs almost inside out... and yet I can't say that I'm impressed with the quality of code that is usually produced. And it goes back to Martin Fowler's quote:

*"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."*

I seem to be of a fairly rare breed of Developer who rates code readability over anything else, and usually this leads to more maintainable/extensible code.
